Learnobot Database Migrations

This directory contains database migration scripts managed by Alembic.

## Common Commands

### Create a new migration
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
```

### Apply migrations
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Downgrade migrations
```bash
alembic downgrade -1  # Go back one migration
alembic downgrade base  # Go back to the beginning
```

### Check current version
```bash
alembic current
```

### View migration history
```bash
alembic history --verbose
```

## Migration Guidelines

1. Always review auto-generated migrations before applying
2. Test migrations on a copy of production data
3. Create meaningful migration messages
4. Include both upgrade() and downgrade() functions
5. Be careful with data migrations - they should be reversible when possible

## Environment Setup

Make sure your database connection string is properly configured in:
- .env file (DATABASE_URL)
- alembic.ini (fallback configuration)

The migrations will automatically use the database URL from your application settings.
